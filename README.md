## Description
Seeking a regression used to predict pricing for real estate properties in Queens

## Target Variable
Listed Price (Douglas Elliman)

URL, Property Type, Address, Neighborhood, Zip Code, Brokerâ€™s Description, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, House Sq. Ft., Property Sq. Ft., Year Built, Patio, Pool, Air Conditioning, Garage, Water View, New Construction, Stucco Siding, Brick Siding, Pre-War, Courtyard, Miles Away from Penn Station, Wood Heat, Garde, Pets Allowed, Stone Siding, Private Storage, Terrace, Aluminum Siding, Cedar Siding, Wooded Area, Wood Siding, Vinyl Siding 

## Data Used
NYC Open Data, Douglas Elliman (Web Scraped), MTA website, MTA Wikipedia (to get neighborhood/borough for each LIRR station)

## Tools Used
Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, sklearn, statsmodels, Seaborn

## Possible Impacts
I was looking for a regression that would allow for proper pricing of single family homes in Queens. This could be used to help analyze properties for a potential real estate investment, or to assist brokerages in pricing their client's houses appropriately.
